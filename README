For me a lot of user.js configurations were either too much or did not do the things I wanted, so I made my own.
The goal of this user.js is to disable as much of Mozilla's bloat as possible and provide a decently private experience without sacrificing convenience and usability. 
This user.js is not meant to provide as much security or privacy as possible, it is just my personal user.js
